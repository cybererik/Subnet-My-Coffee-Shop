# You-Suck-at-Subnetting

The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) introduced **CIDR** in 1993 to replace the "Classful" addressing system. With CIDR the classful requirments of: `Class A = /24, Class B = /16, Class C = /24` were removed. 

**CIDR allows for larger networks to be split into smaller networks**, allowing for greater efficiency. CIDR allows us to assign different prefix lengths `EX: /21 instead of /24 for a Class C.`

These smaller networks are called "subnetworks" or "subnets".
